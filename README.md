# GameAIProDocs
Markdown versions of the GameAIPro Publications(at least those that interest me or I had the time to read).
These are freely available in pdf format on:
https://www.gameaipro.com/

For anyone interested in learning about the technology used to power game AI, I recommend checking it out.


A wide array of topics are covered, to include:
- Pathfinding
- Behaviors
- Optimization Techniques
- And More!
